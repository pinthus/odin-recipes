    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
